# FoodTruckProject

# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jacob Stuart
### Programming student with Skill Distillery

- Iâ€™m currently working on [FoodTruckProject](https://github.com/VulcanMindForge/FoodTruckProject)

- Iâ€™m currently learning **Java**

- All of my projects are available at [https://github.com/VulcanMindForge](https://github.com/VulcanMindForge)

# Description of this project
This program will allow a user to enter up to 5 foodtrucks with information including the trucks name, type of food, and rating. The program will assign a fleet ID to each truck. The user will then have a menu that will let them display one of the following.

List all existing food trucks.
See the average rating of food trucks.
Display the highest-rated food truck.

After the requested information is displayed, the user will be brought back to the menu to choose again. The user will be able to enter quit as an option at this menu to end the program.

# How to use this project
The program will greet the user and prompt the user for a list of up to 5 food trucks. The user will input and rate a list of food trucks. The information requested will be:
Name of the food truck
Type of food made
Satisfaction Rating

After the first food truck is entered, the user will be reminded they can type quit as a truck name to finish entering food trucks. The user will then need to choose from a menu displayed to get information about the trucks they entered. After the information is displayed, the user will be brought back to the menu. If the user hits quit at this menu it will exit the program. The types of information available are:
List all food trucks.
See the average rating for all food trucks
display the highest-rated food truck.

Of note, in the first version of the program the user is prompted to enter the truck information only once, then has a looped menu to display parts of that information.


# Technologies Used
Overall I am learning and using Eclipse IDE to program in Java 1.8. Prior to this assignment we covered: Variables and Constants, Methods, Screen Output and Keyboard Input, Expressions, If/Else, Switch, While loops, For Loops, Cast Numerals, Packages, Stringbuilder, Objects, Classes, Superclasses, JUnit testing, TDD or Testing Driven Developement, UML class diagrams, Encapsulation, Inheritance in Java, Visibility, ASCII and Unicode Data.

I plan to implement as many of these systems as make sense to get a better grasp of their uses 
and best practices.

# Current Progress
Created class files and test file.

# Next Steps
Create UML and adjust as needed
Create stub methods
Create tests


# Lessons learned or reinforced on this project
